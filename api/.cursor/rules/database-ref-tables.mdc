Always use reference tables to enum-like values.
For example, if you have a table of animal breeds, the table should be called `ref_animal_breed`.
All ref tables should have only columns id and value.  ID should be a bigint and the primary key
id should always be auto-incrementing.
There should be a unique key on the `value` column.
