When data modeling, always use singular table names
All non-reference tables should have columns id, uuid, created, and updated.
id should be a bigint, not null, and the primary key
uuid should be a varchar(36), not null, and have a unique key on it.
created should be a datetime and not null.
Default the created column to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.
updated should be a datetime and nullable as it will only be set when the row is updated.
Ensure that updated is set to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP when a row is updated.
